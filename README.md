This exercise is proposed for a mobile robotics course at the Master's level at the Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha. It is designed to help students gain practical experience in key areas of mobile robot systems, including perception, localization, navigation, and control.

The aim of this exercise is to apply theoretical concepts in a hands-on environment, using real or simulated robotic platforms. Students are expected to analyze and implement various algorithms and techniques commonly used in mobile robotics.
